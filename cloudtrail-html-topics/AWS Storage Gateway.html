            Resilience in AWS Storage Gateway
           </h2>
           <p>
            The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability
        Zones.
           </p>
           <p>
            An AWS Region is a physical location around the world where data centers are clustered.
        Each group of logical data centers is called an Availability Zone (AZ). Each AWS Region
        consists of a minimum of three isolated and physically separate AZs within a geographic
        area. Unlike other cloud providers, who often define a region as a single data center, the
        multiple AZ design of every AWS Region offers distinct advantages. Each AZ has independent
        power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency
        networks. If your deployment requires a focus on high availability, you can configure
        services and resources to in multiple AZs to achieve greater fault-tolerance.
           </p>
           <p>
            AWS Regions meet the highest levels of infrastructure security, compliance, and data
        protection. All traffic between AZs is encrypted. The network performance is sufficient to
        accomplish synchronous replication between AZs. AZs make partitioning services and resources
        for high availability easy. If your deployment is partitioned across AZs, your resources are
        better isolated and protected from issues such as power outages, lightning strikes,
        tornadoes, earthquakes, and more. AZs are physically separated by a meaningful distance from
        any other AZ, although all are within 100 km (60 miles) of each other.
           </p>

            You use AWS published API calls to access Storage Gateway through the network. Clients

        with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve
        Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these

              You should treat the AWS Storage Gateway appliance as a managed virtual machine, and
            should not attempt to access or modify its installation in any way. Attempting to
            install scanning software or update any software packages using methods other than the
            normal gateway update mechanism, may cause the gateway to malfunction and could impact
            our ability to support or fix the gateway.

             <p>
              AWS reviews, analyzes, and remediates CVEs on a regular basis. We incorporate fixes

           <p>
            Storage Gateway is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by
        a user, role, or an AWS service in Storage Gateway. CloudTrail captures all API calls for
        Storage Gateway as events. The calls captured include calls from the Storage Gateway console and
        code calls to the Storage Gateway API operations. If you create a trail, you can turn on
        continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Storage Gateway. If
        you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console
        in
            <b>
             Event history
            </b>
            . Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can
        determine the request that was made to Storage Gateway, the IP address from which the request
        was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.
           </p>
           <p>
            To learn more about CloudTrail, see the

            CloudTrail is activated on your AWS account when you create the account. When activity

            For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for

             trail

            allows CloudTrail to deliver log
            files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail
            applies to all AWS Regions. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS
            partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally,
            you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data
            collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

            A trail is a configuration that allows delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3
            bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event
            represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested
            action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files
            aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't appear in any
            specific order.
